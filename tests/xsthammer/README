	================================
	This is work under construction!
	================================


This is going to be a collection of auto-generated test cases. The goal is
to synthesize them with Yosys and Xilinx XST and perform formal equivialence
checks using the Yosys SAT-based equivialence checker. This will hopefully
reveal some bugs in both applications.. ;-)


Generating the Test Cases:
	clang -Wall -o generate generate.cc -lstdc++
	./generate

Running XST Synthesis:
	bash run-xst.sh
	rm -rf xst_temp

Running Yosys Synthesis and Check:
	TBD
