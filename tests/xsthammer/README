	================================
	This is work under construction!
	================================


This is going to be a collection of auto-generated test cases. The goal is
to synthesize them with Yosys and Xilinx XST and perform formal equivialence
checks using the Yosys SAT-based equivialence checker. This will hopefully
reveal some bugs in both applications.. ;-)

Simply run 'make' to generate all test cases and run all the tests.
(Use 'make -j N' to use N parallel cores.)
