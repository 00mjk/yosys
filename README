yosys -- Yosys Open SYnthesis Suite
===================================

This is a framework for RTL synthesis tools. It currently has
extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of
synthesis algorithms for various application domains.

Yosys can be adapted to perform any synthesis job by combining
the existing passes (algorithms) using synthesis scripts and
adding additional passes as needed by extending the yosys C++
code base.

Yosys is free software licensed under the ISC license (a GPL
compatible license that is similar in terms to the MIT license
or the 2-clause BSD license).


Web Site
========

More information and documentation can be found on the Yosys web site:

	http://www.clifford.at/yosys/


Getting Started
===============

You need a C++ compiler with C++11 support (up-to-date CLANG or GCC is
recommended) and some standard tools such as GNU Flex, GNU Bison, and GNU Make.
The Qt4 library is needed for the yosys SVG viewer, that is used to display
schematics, the minisat library is required for the SAT features in yosys
and TCL for the scripting functionality. The extensive test suite requires
Icarus Verilog. For example on Ubuntu Linux 12.04 LTS the following commands
will install all prerequisites for building yosys:

	$ sudo apt-get install git
	$ sudo apt-get install g++
	$ sudo apt-get install clang
	$ sudo apt-get install make
	$ sudo apt-get install bison
	$ sudo apt-get install flex
	$ sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
	$ sudo apt-get install tcl8.5-dev
	$ sudo apt-get install minisat
	$ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
	$ sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev
	$ sudo apt-get install mercurial
	$ sudo apt-get install iverilog
	$ sudo apt-get install graphviz

To configure the build system to use a specific set of compiler and
build configuration, use one of

	$ make config-clang-debug
	$ make config-gcc-debug
	$ make config-release

For other compilers and build configurations it might be
necessary to make some changes to the config section of the
Makefile.

	$ vi Makefile

To build Yosys simply type 'make' in this directory.

	$ make
	$ make test
	$ sudo make install

If you encounter any problems during build, make sure to check the section
"Workarounds for known build problems" at the end of this README file.

To also build and install ABC (recommended) use the following commands:

	$ make abc
	$ sudo make install-abc

Yosys can be used with the interactive command shell, with
synthesis scripts or with command line arguments. Let's perform
a simple synthesis job using the interactive command shell:

	$ ./yosys
	yosys>

the command "help" can be used to print a list of all available
commands and "help <command>" to print details on the specified command:

	yosys> help help

reading the design using the verilog frontend:

	yosys> read_verilog tests/simple/fiedler-cooley.v

writing the design to the console in yosys's internal format:

	yosys> write_ilang

convert processes ("always" blocks) to netlist elements and perform
some simple optimizations:

	yosys> proc; opt

display design netlist using the yosys svg viewer:

	yosys> show

the same thing using 'gv' as postscript viewer:

	yosys> show -format ps -viewer gv

translating netlist to gate logic and perform some simple optimizations:

	yosys> techmap; opt

write design netlist to a new verilog file:

	yosys> write_verilog synth.v

a simmilar synthesis can be performed using yosys command line options only:

	$ ./yosys -o synth.v -p proc -p opt -p techmap -p opt tests/simple/fiedler-cooley.v

or using a simple synthesis script:

	$ cat synth.ys
	read_verilog tests/simple/fiedler-cooley.v
	proc; opt; techmap; opt
	write_verilog synth.v

	$ ./yosys synth.ys

It is also possible to only have the synthesis commands but not the read/write
commands in the synthesis script:

	$ cat synth.ys
	proc; opt; techmap; opt

	$ ./yosys -o synth.v tests/simple/fiedler-cooley.v synth.ys

The following synthesis script works reasonable for all designs:

	# check design hierarchy
	hierarchy

	# translate processes (always blocks) and memories (arrays)
	proc; memory; opt

	# detect and optimize FSM encodings
	fsm; opt

	# convert to gate logic
	techmap; opt

If ABC (http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/) is installed and
a cell library is given in the liberty file mycells.lib, the following
synthesis script will synthesize for the given cell library:

	# the high-level stuff
	hierarchy; proc; memory; opt; fsm; opt

	# mapping to internal cell library
	techmap; opt

	# mapping flip-flops to mycells.lib
	dfflibmap -liberty mycells.lib

	# mapping logic to mycells.lib
	abc -liberty mycells.lib

	# cleanup
	opt

If you do not have a liberty file but want to test this synthesis script,
you can use the file techlibs/cmos/cmos_cells.lib from the yosys sources.

Yosys is under construction. A more detailed documentation will follow.


Unsupported Verilog-2005 Features
=================================

The following Verilog-2005 features are not supported by
yosys and there are currently no plans to add support
for them:

- Non-sythesizable language features as defined in
	IEC 62142(E):2005 / IEEE Std. 1364.1(E):2002

- The "tri", "triand", "trior", "wand" and "wor" net types

- The "config" keyword and library map files

- The "disable", "primitive" and "specify" statements

- Latched logic (is synthesized as logic with feedback loops)


Verilog Attributes and non-standard features
============================================

- The 'full_case' attribute on case statements is supported
  (also the non-standard "// synopsys full_case" directive)

- The 'parallel_case' attribute on case statements is supported
  (also the non-standard "// synopsys parallel_case" directive)

- The "// synopsys translate_off" and "// synopsys translate_on"
  directives are also supported (but the use of `ifdef .. `endif
  is strongly recommended instead).

- The "nomem2reg" attribute on modules or arrays prohibits the
  automatic early conversion of arrays to separate registers.

- The "mem2reg" attribute on modules or arrays forces the early
  conversion of arrays to separate registers.

- The "nolatches" attribute on modules or always-blocks
  prohibits the generation of logic-loops for latches. Instead
  all not explicitly assigned values default to x-bits. This does
  not affect clocked storage elements such as flip-flops.

- The "nosync" attribute on registers prohibits the generation of a
  storage element. The register itself will always have all bits set
  to 'x' (undefined). The variable may only be used as blocking assigned
  temporary variable within an always block. This is mostly used internally
  by yosys to synthesize verilog functions and access arrays.

- The "placeholder" attribute on modules is used to mark empty stub modules
  that have the same ports as the real thing but do not contain information
  on the internal configuration. This modules are only used by the synthesis
  passes to identify input and output ports of cells. The verilog backend
  also does not output placeholder modules on default.

- The "keep" attribute on cells is used to mark cells that should never be
  removed by the optimizer. This is used for example for cells that have
  hidden connections that are not part of the netlist, such as IO pads.

- In addition to the (* ... *) attribute syntax, yosys supports
  the non-standard {* ... *} attribute syntax to set default attributes
  for everything that comes after the {* ... *} statement. (Reset
  by adding an empty {* *} statement.) The preprocessor define
  __YOSYS_ENABLE_DEFATTR__ must be set in order for this feature to be active.


Workarounds for known build problems
====================================

You might get an error message like this one during build when building with
a recent version of gcc:

	/usr/include/minisat/utils/Options.h:285:29: error:
	unable to find string literal operator ‘operator"" PRIi64’

This is a bug in the minisat header. It can be fixed by adding spaces before
and after each occurrence of PRIi64 in the header file:

	 sudo sed -i 's/PRIi64/ & /' /usr/include/minisat/utils/Options.h


Roadmap / Large-scale TODOs
===========================

- Technology mapping for real-world applications (specific FPGAs and ASIC processes)
- Improve standard complience of const folding and parameters (mostly expression widths)
- Implement SAT-based formal equivialence checker based on existing SAT framework
- Re-implement Verilog frontend (cleaner AST format, pipeline of well structured AST transformations)


TODOs / Open Bugs
=================

- Implement missing Verilog 2005 features:

  - Signed constants
  - Constant functions
  - Indexed part selects
  - Multi-dimensional arrays
  - ROM modeling using "initial" blocks
  - Built-in primitive gates (and, nand, cmos, nmos, pmos, etc..)
  - Ignore what needs to be ignored (e.g. drive and charge strengths)
  - Check standard vs. implementation to identify missing features

- Miscellaneous TODO items: 

  - Actually use range information on parameters
  - Add brief source code documentation to most passes and kernel code
  - Implement mux-to-tribuf pass and rebalance mixed mux/tribuf trees
  - Add edit commands for changing the design (delete, add, modify objects)
  - Improve TCL support (add mechanism for inspecting the design from TCL)
  - Add full support for $lut cell type (const evaluation, sat solving, etc.)
  - Support for registering designs (as collection of modules) to CellTypes
  - Smarter resource sharing pass (add MUXes and get rid of duplicated cells)
  - Refactoring of AST frontend (clean expr width/sign code, AST passes)
