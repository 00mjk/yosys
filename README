yosys -- Yosys Open SYnthesis Suite
===================================

This is a framework for RTL synthesis tools. It is highly
experimental and under construction. The goal for now is
to implement an extensible Verilog-2005 synthesis tool.

The aim of this tool is to generate valid logic netlists
from HDL designs in a manner that allows for easy addition
of extra synthesis passes. This tool does not aim at generating
efficient logic netlists. This can be done by passing the
output of Yosys to a low-level synthesis tool such as ABC.

Yosys is free software licensed under the ISC license (a GPL
compatible licence that is similar in terms to the MIT license
or the 2-clause BSD license).


Unsupported Verilog-2005 Features
=================================

The following Verilog-2005 features are not supported by
yosys and there are currently no plans to add support
for them:

- Non-sythesizable language features as defined in
	IEC 62142(E):2005 / IEEE Std. 1364.1(E):2002

- The "tri", "triand", "trior", "wand" and "wor" net types

- The "library" and "configuration" source file formats 

- The "disable" and "primitive" statements

- Latched logic (is synthesized as logic with feedback loops)


Verilog Attributes and non-standard features
============================================

- The 'full_case' attribute on case statements is supported
  (also the non-standard "// synopsys full_case" directive)

- The "// synopsys translate_off" and "// synopsys translate_on"
  directives are also supported (but the use of `ifdef .. `endif
  is strongly recommended instead).

- The "nomem2reg" attribute on modules or arrays prohibits the
  automatic early conversion of arrays to seperate registers.

- The "nolatches" attribute on modules or always-blocks
  prohibits the generation of logic-loops for latches. Instead
  all not explicitly assigned values default to x-bits.

- In addition to the (* ... *) attribute syntax, yosys supports
  the non-standard {* ... *} attribute syntax to set default attributes
  for everything that comes after the {* ... *} statement. (Reset
  by adding an empty {* *} statement.) The preprocessor define
  __YOSYS_ENABLE_DEFATTR__ must be set in order for this featre to be active.


TODOs / Open Bugs
=================

- Write "design and implementation of.." document

- Add brief sourcecode documentation to:

   - Most passes and kernel functionalities

- Implement missing Verilog 2005 features:

  - Signed constants
  - ROM modelling using "initial" blocks
  - Builtin primitive gates (and, nand, cmos, nmos, pmos, etc..)
  - Ignore what needs to be ignored (e.g. drive and charge strenghts)
  - Check standard vs. implementation to identify missing features

- Actually use range information on parameters

- Implement mux-to-tribuf pass and rebalance mixed mux/tribuf trees

- TCL and Python interfaces to frontends, passes, backends and RTLIL

- Additional internal cell types: $bitcount, $pla, $lut and $pmux

- Subsystem for selecting stuff (and limiting scope of passes)

- Support for registering designs (as collection of modules) to CellTypes

- Kernel support for collections of cells (from input/output cones, etc)

- Smarter resource sharing pass (add MUXes and get rid of duplicated cells)

- FSM state encoding and technology mapping
