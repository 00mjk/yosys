Notes on buildin yosys with verific support on amd64 when you only have the
i386 eval version of Verific:


1.) Use a Makefile.conf like the following one:

--snip--
CONFIG := clang-debug
ENABLE_TCL := 0
ENABLE_QT4 := 0
ENABLE_ABC := 0
ENABLE_VERIFIC := 1
CXXFLAGS += -m32
LDFLAGS += -m32
--snap--


2.) Install the neccessary multilib packages.

Hint: On debian/ubuntu the multilib packages have names such as
libreadline-dev:amd64 or lib32readline6-dev, depending on the version
of the system you are working with.

Hint: On Ubuntu 14.04 there is a problem with the 32bit libz
package. A workaround is running the following command in the
yosys source directory:

    ln -s /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/zconf.h .


3.) Run 'make' and 'make install' as usual.
