In this directory you will find out, how to generate a spice output
operating in two modes, analog or event-driven mode supported by ngspice
xspice sub-module.

Each test bench can be run separately by either running:

- testbench.sh, to start analog simulation or
- testbench_digital.sh for mixed-signal digital simulation.

The later case also includes pure verilog simulation using the iverilog
and gtkwave to represent the results.
